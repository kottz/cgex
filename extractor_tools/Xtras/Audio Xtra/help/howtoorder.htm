    <td valign="top" align="left">The unregistered version of Audio Xtra is fully-functional and may be used for evaluation, nonprofit and educational purposes only: commercial distribution is strictly prohibited. A registered version of the Xtra can be used in commercial products, and may be purchased online at <a href="http://xtras.tabuleiro.com">xtras.tabuleiro.com</a>, using a secure server. At our web site you can also consult our purchase policy, purchase instructions, payment, delivery and security methods.<br>
      <p class="margin">If you decide to buy the Xtra you don't need to download a new copy of the software. After your order is processed you will receive an e-mail with a serial number to register the software you've already installed on your machine.</p>
    <p class="margin">To register the Xtra you should use the axRegister() function, usually called at the startup of your movie, <span class="bold">or before an Audio Xtra function is used</span>. More information about specific syntax can be found at the <a href="xtrafunctions.htm">Xtra Functions</a> page. Please keep your serial number archived for future reference.</p></td>
