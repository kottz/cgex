      <p class="bold">INSTALLING THE XTRA ON WINDOWS - Director MX and Director 8.5   </p>
      <p>Decompress the installation .zip file. This  will unpack the Xtra, documentation and sample 
        files to a folder named &quot;Audio Xtra&quot; on your machine. To install the Xtra, just copy the file Windows\AudioXtra.x32 to 
        the Director 8.5 or Director MX XTRAS folder. If you have previously installed an older copy of the Xtra (previous versions were named as resaudio.x32) make sure to remove or replace it.</p>
      <p class="margin">These are the default locations of the Xtras folder 
        for each application:</p>
      <p class="margin">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="marginbold">Director 8.5- C:\Program Files\Macromedia\Director 8.5\Xtras</p>
      <p class="marginbold"> Director MX- C:\Program Files\Macromedia\Director MX\Xtras</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Finally, you need to edit the xtrainfo.txt file to include information about Audio Xtra. This information is used by the Shockwave publishing features in Director. The xtrainfo.txt file is located by default at:</p>
      <p class="margin">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="margin"><span class="marginbold">Director 8.5 - C:\Program Files\Macromedia\Director 8.5\xtrainfo.txt</span></p>
      <p class="margin"><span class="marginbold">Director MX - C:\Program Files\Macromedia\Director MX\xtrainfo.txt</span></p>
      <p class="margin">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Double click the file to open it in notepad, or alternatively edit with any other text editor. You need to add the following line to the end of the file:</p>
      <p class="margin">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="marginbold"> [#namePPC:&quot;Audio Xtra&quot;, #nameW32:&quot;AudioXtra.x32&quot;, 
        #package:&quot;http://download.tabuleiro.com/packages/Audio/61/AudioXtra&quot;] </p>
      <p class="marginbold">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You may want to customize this line in the future, to instruct Director to download Audio Xtra Shockwave packages from the same server that hosts your Shockwave applications. This is covered in more detail at the <a href="shockwave.htm">Using the Xtra in Shockwave</a> section of the documentation. Restart Director for the changes to take effect. <span class="margin">The Xtra should be listed when you issue the command &quot;put the xtralist&quot; in the message window. The Xtra functions will also be listed when you click the message window Scripting Xtras button</span> (Director MX). </p>
