      <p class="bold">INSTALLING THE XTRA ON WINDOWS - Director MX 2004 </p>
      <p>If you have not done so, we recommend updating to Director MX 2004 version 10.1 before installing the Xtra. This will allow creation of projectors for Mac Classic and OSX (Director MX 2004 without the update can only create cross platform projectors for OSX.) </p>
      <p class="margin">Decompress the installation .zip file. This will unpack the Xtra, documentation and sample files to a folder named &quot;Audio Xtra&quot; on your machine. To install the Xtra, just copy the file Windows\AudioXtra.x32 to the Director MX 2004 XTRAS folder. If your copy of Director MX 2004 is installed at the default location, the Windows Xtra file will be located at:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="marginbold">C:\Program Files\Macromedia\Director MX 2004\Configuration\Xtras\AudioXtra.x32</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Now you need to install the files necessary for creation of cross-platform projector for Mac OSX. Go back to the <span class="margin">&quot;Audio Xtra&quot;</span> directory where the Xtra files were unpacked. Open the <strong>Mac Carbon</strong> directory. Now copy the files &quot;Audio  Xtra.data&quot; and &quot;Audio  Xtra.rsrc&quot; files to the &quot;Configuration\Cross Platform Resources\Macintosh\Xtras&quot; directory used by Director MX 2004. In a default installation of Director these files will end up at the following locations:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="margin"><span class="marginbold">C:\Program Files\Macromedia\Director MX 2004\Configuration\Cross Platform Resources\Macintosh\Xtras\Audio Xtra.data </span></p>
      <p class="margin"><span class="marginbold">C:\Program Files\Macromedia\Director MX 2004\Configuration\Cross Platform Resources\Macintosh\Xtras\Audio Xtra.rsrc</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If you are running Director MX 2004 10.1, you can also install the files necessary for creation of cross-platform projector for Mac Classic. Again, go back to the <span class="margin">&quot;Audio Xtra&quot;</span> directory where the Xtra files were unpacked. Open the <strong>Mac Classic</strong> directory. Now copy the files &quot;Audio Xtra.data&quot; and &quot;Audio Xtra.rsrc&quot; files to the &quot;Configuration\Cross Platform Resources\Classic\Xtras&quot; directory used by Director MX 2004. In a default installation of Director these files will end up at the following locations:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="margin"><span class="marginbold">C:\Program Files\Macromedia\Director MX 2004\Configuration\Cross Platform Resources\Classic\Xtras\Audio Xtra.data </span></p>
      <p class="margin"><span class="marginbold">C:\Program Files\Macromedia\Director MX 2004\Configuration\Cross Platform Resources\Classic\Xtras\Audio Xtra.rsrc</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>      
      <p>Finally, you need to edit the xtrainfo.txt file to include information about Audio Xtra. This information is used by the Shockwave and cross-platform publishing features in Director MX 2004, to locate the files needed when assembling the OSX and Classic versions of your projector. The xtrainfo.txt file is located by default at:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="margin"><span class="marginbold">C:\Program Files\Macromedia\Director MX 2004\Configuration\xtrainfo.txt</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Double click the file to open it in notepad, or alternatively edit with any other text editor. You need to add the following line to the end of the file:</p>
      <p class="margin">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="marginbold"> [#namePPC:&quot;Audio Xtra&quot;, #nameW32:&quot;AudioXtra.x32&quot;, 
        #package:&quot;http://download.tabuleiro.com/packages/Audio/61/AudioXtra&quot;] 
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You may want to customize this line in the future, to instruct Director to download Audio Xtra Shockwave packages from the same server that hosts your Shockwave applications. This is covered in more detail at the <a href="shockwave.htm">Using the Xtra in Shockwave</a> section of the documentation.  Restart Director for the changes to take effect. <span class="margin">The Xtra should be listed when you issue the command &quot;put the xtralist&quot; in the message window. The Xtra functions will also be listed when you click the message window Scripting Xtras button.</span></p>
