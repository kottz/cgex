            <p class="bold">CREATING A CROSS-PLATFORM OR STANDARD PROJECTOR - Director MX 2004 and Director 11</p>
            <p>These versions of Director include the ability to create Windows projectors when hosted on Mac OS X, and vice-versa. Director MX 2004 can create projectors for older versions of MacOS (8 and 9) as well. However, this only works correctly if Director is configured to locate and include the proper Xtra files for &quot;the other&quot; platform. Please make sure the appropriate files are installed in the Configuration\Cross platform resources Director folder according to the <a href="installation.htm">installation</a> notes, and also make sure the Configuration\xtrainfo.txt file contains information about Audio Xtra (this procedure is also covered in the installation instructions)</p>
            <p class="margin">Audio Xtra uses Macromedia Xtras to provide some additional import/export services, so make sure all the Xtras necessary for proper operation of the Audio Xtra are also included in your movie. You must include the following Macromedia Xtras in your Director movie Xtras list or in the projector Xtras folder, depending on what sound file formats your projector will be working with: </p>

            <p class="margin"><span class="bold">Audio Xtra :</span> always needed </p>
            <p class="margin"><span class="bold">Mix Services:</span> always needed </p>
            <p class="margin"><span class="bold">MacroMix: </span>always needed </p>

            <p class="margin"><span class="bold">Sun AU Import Export:</span> optionally needed to record and play Sun AU files</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="margin">With your .dir file opened, please select the MODIFY-&gt;MOVIE-&gt;XTRAS menu item. Click the ADD button , and include the Audio Xtra (AudioXtra.x32 on Windows) in the first movie used in your projector. You can then proceed and include the remaining Xtras listed above, if they are not already included. If you plan to use the Xtra in Shockwave you can also check the DOWNLOAD IF NEEDED checkbox for each Xtra. More information about this procedure can be found at the USING THE XTRA IN SHOCKWAVE section of the documentation. Save the file and the changes will be recorded to your movie.</p>
            <p class="margin">Assuming the cross-platform files are already installed and configured correctly you can now invoke the FILE-&gt;PUBLISH SETTINGS menu item to configure the parameters for your projector. You can then configure what types of projectors will be created, and you can also create a Shockwave version of your file if necessary. </p>
            <p class="margin">In the FILES tab you can add additional Director movies to your projector.  To finalize just click the PUBLISH button. Director  saves the publishing settings with your Director movie, and future projectors can be created simply by choosing the FILE-&gt;PUBLISH menu item. </p>
            <p class="margin">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="bold">CREATING A STANDARD WINDOWS OR MACOS PROJECTOR - Director 8.5 and MX</p>
      <p>Director 8.5 and MX can only create native projectors. Windows projectors need to be created on a Windows machine, and Macintosh projectors need to be created on a Macintosh computer. However, Director movies (.dir files) containing Audio Xtra scripts don't need any modification in order to work on both platforms, provided your scripts already take care of selecting the appropriate file extensions and file formats if necessary. A developer can work primarily on the Mac and only transfer the final .dir file to Director for Windows in order to create a Windows projector, or vice-versa. The only requirement is to install the Xtra on both platforms. Instructions for installing the Xtra can be found in the download packages. Please notice that Audio Xtra serial numbers are cross-platform: you can use the same serial number with the axRegister() function on your movie to register the software on both Mac and Windows. </p>
            <p class="margin"> Audio Xtra uses Macromedia Xtras to provide some additional import/export services, so make sure all the Xtras necessary for proper operation of the Audio Xtra are also included in your movie.

Now you just need to select CREATE PROJECTOR from the FILE menu in Director to create your projector, and all the necessary files will be included in it. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span class="bold">TIP:</span> You can also deliver the required Xtras in a folder named XTRAS, located in the same directory of your Projector, if you do not want to embed the Xtra file into your projector. This is recommended for faster startup of your program.</p>
