      <p class="bold">INSTALLING THE XTRA ON  MAC OS 8 AND 9 - Director 8.5 </p>
      <p><span class="margin">Running under OSX, double-click the installation .dmg file. This will mount a disk named &quot;Audio Xtra&quot; on your desktop</span>. To install the Xtra just copy the file &quot;Audio  Xtra&quot; from the Mac Classic folder to the Xtras folder of your Director 8.5 installation. The final pathname for the Xtra will be for example: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="marginbold">Macintosh HD:OS9 Applications:Macromedia Director 8.5:Xtras:Audio Xtra </p>
      <p class="marginbold">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Finally, you need to edit the xtrainfo.txt file to include information about Audio Xtra. This information is used by the Shockwave publishing features in Director. The xtrainfo.txt file is located in the directory where Director 8.5 was installed, for example at:</p>
      <p class="margin">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="margin"><span class="marginbold">Macintosh HD:OS9 Applications:Macromedia Director 8.5:xtrainfo.txt</span></p>
      <p class="margin">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Double click the file to open it in SimpleText, or another editor capable of saving plain text files. You need to add the following line to the end of the file:</p>
      <p class="margin">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="marginbold"> [#namePPC:&quot;Audio Xtra&quot;, #nameW32:&quot;AudioXtra.x32&quot;, 
        #package:&quot;http://download.tabuleiro.com/packages/Audio/61/AudioXtra&quot;] </p>
      <p class="marginbold">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You may want to customize this line in the future, to instruct Director to download Audio Xtra Shockwave packages from the same server that hosts your Shockwave applications. This is covered in more detail at the <a href="shockwave.htm">Using the Xtra in Shockwave</a> section of the documentation. Restart Director for the changes to take effect. <span class="margin">The Xtra should be listed when you issue the command &quot;put the xtralist&quot; in the message window.</span></p>
