      <p class="bold">INSTALLING THE XTRA ON MAC OSX  - Director MX </p>
      <p><span class="margin">Double-click the installation .dmg file. This will mount a disk named &quot;Audio Xtra&quot; on your desktop</span>.</p>
      <p class="margin">The first step is to copy the OSX version of the Xtra, which will be used in the authoring environment and also when creating OSX projectors. This file is located in the install disk image, at:</p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="marginbold">Audio Xtra/Mac Carbon/Audio Xtra</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This file  needs to be copied to the Director MX Xtras folder. The final pathname for the OSX Xtra in a default installation of Director MX will be:</p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="marginbold">OSX Volume Name/Applications/Macromedia Director MX/Xtras/Audio Xtra </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Director MX running on Mac OSX can also be used to create Classic projectors, for Mac OS versions 8 and 9. In order to enable this feature you need to copy the Classic version of Audio Xtra to the correct location in your Director MX installation. First locate the Classic version of Audio Xtra in the install disk:</p>
      <p class="marginbold">&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="marginbold">Audio Xtra/Mac Classic/Audio Xtra</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This file needs to be copied to the following location in the Director MX folder: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="marginbold">OSX Volume Name/Applications/Macromedia Director MX/Classic MacOS/Xtras/Audio Xtra</p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Finally, you need to edit the xtrainfo.txt file to include information about Audio Xtra. This information is used by the Shockwave and cross-platform publishing features in Director MX 2004, to locate the files needed when assembling the Classic MacOS version of your projector. The xtrainfo.txt file is located by default at:</p>
      <p class="margin">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="margin"><span class="marginbold">OSX Volume Name/Applications/Macromedia Director MX/xtrainfo.txt</span></p>
      <p class="margin">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Double click the file to open it in TextEdit, or alternatively edit with another text editor. Make sure to save the file in plain text format, though. You need to add the following line to the end of the file:</p>
      <p class="margin">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="marginbold"> [#namePPC:&quot;Audio Xtra&quot;, #nameW32:&quot;AudioXtra.x32&quot;, 
        #package:&quot;http://download.tabuleiro.com/packages/Audio/61/AudioXtra&quot;] </p>
      <p class="marginbold">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You may want to customize this line in the future, to instruct Director to download Audio Xtra Shockwave packages from the same server that hosts your Shockwave applications. This is covered in more detail at the <a href="shockwave.htm">Using the Xtra in Shockwave</a> section of the documentation. Restart Director for the changes to take effect. <span class="margin">The Xtra should be listed when you issue the command &quot;put the xtralist&quot; in the message window. The Xtra functions will also be listed when you click the message window Scripting Xtras button.</span></p>
